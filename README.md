Project Description

This memory simulator project implements a software-based memory management unit (MMU) using Python, showcasing various page replacement algorithms including FIFO, LRU, and Optimal. The program simulates the process of translating logical to physical addresses and handles page faults with a simulated physical memory and TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer). Users can specify the reference sequence file, the number of frames, and the page replacement algorithm via command line, allowing for dynamic testing of different memory scenarios. The project includes functionality to read a binary backing store, mimic real-world memory operations, and calculate and display memory access statistics such as page faults and TLB hits.
